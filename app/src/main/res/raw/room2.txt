You wake up in a blizzard, your head pounding.  You look around in the darkness, but can't see your friend.  You hear a scream from the treeline to your right.
The area surrounding you is a snowed in forest.  The path to the north and south is overgrown with strange vines, and a treeline to the west is the only way out.
You feel bla.
